Note that these things are not projects I am supervising as part of my PhD, these are things I am doing for fun, and in general not very academic.

#### Robotics
- **Optimal behavour of a vacuuming robot to cover the floor space efficiently:**
This would probably entail generating 'realistic' rooms automatically, deciding what sensors a vacuum robot should have (I am thinking only proximity), and what possible behaviours a robot can follow from that.
- **Landing a rocket**: This would involve ..

#### Software
- **Traveling Salesman Problem-Art**: This involves approximating an image via a bunch of dots, and connecting them with the shortest path.
Possible topics to pursue here are: optimal stippling, benchmarking different approaches of TSP-solvers, interfacing between python and cpp.
- **Simulating a leg through a pedal-stroke**:
Following up on my project I did before, I want to see when (and how) we actually apply pressure on the pedal.
- **Exploring SAT solvers**: ...
