Inspired by Kevin Lynagh, I maintain an ongoing list of ideas that I want to work on eventually - and possibly pair on? Some of them are inspirde by a bunch of research papers that I want to replicate to better understand the intricacies, some of them come from unanswered questions that come up.

If you have interest/comments/know of something that already exists - please let me know, and get in touch!

# Data stuff
The whole backlog of [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/backlog/) is fantastic to get some ideas for data science/visual storytelling projects.

- Where are city centers of big cities located? How does it change over time, and how do opinions diverge with the size of a city? <br>
   Motivated by the fact that Berlin as several (2?) 'city centers' - do other cities have that as well?.

- [Passing networks (PDF)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00534.pdf) in soccer over the curse of a season. How do passing networks change if the coach is replaced? Are there general trends visible in winning teams? <br>
   There is an additional paper doing a deep dive of FC Barcelona in their most successful season [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49969-2). Data for one season for several leagues is available [here](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000/4).

# Technical 
- RRT with time
- Optimal control of things in SO2 space
- Examining the effect of modern stepsize controllers in numerical control.

# Papers
- [This paper](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2018/10/6850.html) by Eric Kerrigan seems novel.
- Rocket landing by Lars Blackmore - possibly compare it with other things.
- About MHE - constrained state estimation, the counterpart to MPC for state estimation
