I am an engineer and data scientist interested in control systems, optimization, and technology in general. I currently work at BCG Gamma, the data science arm of a management and strategy consulting firm. 
Before that, I have been a mechanical engineering student at ETH Zurich, and have focussed on robotics, systems and control. 

I like rowing, all kinds of other sports, and to my friends delight I am an avid cook.
