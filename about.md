I am currently a PhD student in [Marc Toussaint's](https://marc-toussaint.net) group, working on task and motion planning (TAMP) using optimization techniques, with inspiration form control theory.

I have a strong interest in control systems, optimization, numerical methods, and technology in general. Before taking on my current position, I have been a mechanical engineering student at ETH Zurich, and have focussed on robotics, systems and control. I did several internships in various companies (notably Amazon and BCG Gamma).

I like rowing, all kinds of other sports, and to my friends delight I am an avid cook.
