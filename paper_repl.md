Sometimes, I am interested in academic papers, and replicate them to test out their weaknesses, strengths, and compare them to other research myself. This also helps me understand the approach, results, and everything in between much better than only reading it. Sometimes I also find mistakes.

### Fast Generation of Collision-Free Trajectories for Robot Swarms Using GPU Acceleration
Claiming to be a scalable optimization based method of generating paths for multi agent systems with a large number of agents, the paper seems to be extremely reliable on the initialization of the problem. Having worked on a SQP approach to the same problem, I wanted to compare the two methods.

### Rapidly exploring random trees
Both the original paper on rapidly exploring random trees, and arguably the most important extension of it are quite readable, and remarkably easy to implement. In addtion to replicating some of the experiments and simulations of the paper, I created some of my own. In another pproject, I compared RRT(\*) with other approaches of motion planning.

### Flocking for Multi Agent dynamic systems
The paper by Olfati-Saber is one of the most important on distributed control of multi agent systems. While the algorithms are simple, the arising behaviours can be astonishing.
