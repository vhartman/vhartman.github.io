I am a PhD student in [Marc Toussaint's](https://marc-toussaint.net) group, working on task and motion planning (TAMP) using optimization techniques, in addition to sampling based planners, with inspiration from control theory. I am associated with [IntCDC](https://www.intcdc.uni-stuttgart.de/), and am involved in several projects at the intersection of robotics and architecture.

I have a strong interest in control systems, optimization, numerical methods, and technology in general. Before taking on my current position, I have been a mechanical engineering student at ETH Zurich, and have focussed on robotics, systems and control. I did several internships in various companies (notably Amazon and BCG Gamma).

I like rowing, all kinds of other sports, and to my friends delight I am an avid cook.
