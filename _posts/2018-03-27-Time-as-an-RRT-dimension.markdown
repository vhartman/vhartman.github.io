Traditionally, RRTs use configuration or the workspace directly. A major difficulty that comes up in that case are time dependent obstacles. However, when using time as an additional dimension in the workspace, the moving obstacles become 'stationary'. A simple illustration for a one dimensional problem enhanced by time as a second dimension is shown below.
