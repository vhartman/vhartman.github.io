For my bachelor thesis, I worked on a prototype of a stiffness sensing catheter, where I did everything from the initial simulations of the sensor, to the fabrication of the final prototype and the validation of the simulated and designed properties. The last prototype is displayed below:

# Stiffness sensing
# Displacement sensing

# Results
