<p class="preface">
    I am abusing robot arm in our lab for things that could be done quicker by hand.
    I do see this partially as 'learning a bit more about real-life robotics problems', and partially as the first step towards doing the same thing I am doing here with two robots simultaneously.

[Stippling](https://enhancedrawing.com/what-is-stippling-in-art/) is a drawing technique that only uses dots, that create darker and lighter areas by varying the density of the dots.
In doing so, images can be approximated.
Stippling could essentially be seen as a analog version of dithering{% include sidenote.html text='[Here](https://mattwidmann.net/notes/plotting-raster-images/) is a decent overview on plotting raster images in general - stippling being one of them.' %}.
