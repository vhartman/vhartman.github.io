Ligretto is a card game where reaction speed, and keeping a good overview on the state of the playing field matters a lot.
However, there is also a large dose of chance in it, since you can get very lucky with the cards you get dealt.
In this post, I want to figure out how much the outcome of the game is influenced by skill (speed, reaction time, overview of the game), and how much is luck.

# The rules of Ligretto
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligretto) summarizes the rules of the game really well - I'll try to make it even shorter here:

> There are cards of four different colors, with values 1-10.
Only cards of the same color, and the consecutive value of the current 'top-card' of the stack can be laid on top of the stack (cards with value 1 can always be laid down to start a new stack).
Every player has a number of open cards on the table, and a number of turned cards stacked next to them.
If a table card is laid on a stack on the field, or starts a new stack, the empty spot is filled up with a card from the stack.

>In addition, every player has hand cards, which the players go through repeatedly (and only look at every 3rd card) to check if one of these can be laid down.
If someone finished all his cards from the stack, the game is over and the points are calculated: the number of cards laid down by the player, minus the remaining cards on the stack, times two.
All players play simultaneously, thus competing in laing down cards first, and laying as many as possible as quickly as possible.

> The overall game usually ends once one of the players has a cumulative sum of points that is higher than some threshold.

#### House rules
As is tradition, no one actually plays any game how its intended by the manufacturer ([Monopoly and the auction of property](https://www.insider.com/monopoly-auction-rule-changes-game-2017-11#:~:text=According%20to%20Monopoly's%20official%20rules,less%20than%20they%20usually%20would.) being the most famous case here).
In our case, we usually do the shuffling of the hand cards slightly different: we shuffle every time you went through all your hand cards instead of the intended 'only when no one can put down any cards anymore'.

I will simulate both cases, and check how this changes the outcome of the games<sup>2</sup>.

I am assuming that playing be the proper rules lessens the advantage of quicker players somewhat.

# Simulating the game
Everyone is playing simultaneously, so a multithreaded approach seems to make sense to simulate the game on a first glance.
Instead of going down that route (and probably fighting with memory, access and deadlock issues), I decided to simulate an 'action-based' approach, meaning that I store the state of the playing field, query all the players if they can do something, and figure out when they would do it.

I.e. I generate the events/actions coming from the players, and apply them one by one to the state depending on when the player would do it.
Such an approach also allows to incorporate reaction time, how long a specific player takes to lay down a card, and allows a different player to 'intercept' an opponent by having e.g. a faster reaction time.

This is repeated until a player is finished (i.e. if no cards are on one players stack anymore).

#### Game state
The simulation of the game keeps track of the state of the playing field, and the state of all players.

- The state of the playing field consists of the currently active stacks of cards on the playing field, and the minimum time-stamp of all players as the current time.
- The state of each player consists of the hand cards, the index which points to the currently available hand card, the open cards on the table, and the cards on the stack.

#### Action based system, and time keeping
The state of the game can be altered by actions taken by a player.
Each of these actions take some time, and if a player is too slow, another player can beat the previous one to laying down a card onto a stack.
Hence, in the simulation, the actions are modeled to be taking 3 time-slices: i) the time until an action is actually taken, ii) the time  the action takes, and iii) the time after an action was taken

The possible actions, and the associated times are:
- Proceeding to the next handcard
- Laying down a handcard
- Laying down a card from the table, and subsequently uncovering a card from the stack
- Shuffling the handcards

#### Shuffling Cards
[Shuffling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffling) is a science in itself, mostly perfected at casinos.
In our case, we are interested specifically in what happens in between rounds - shuffling there is not perfect, and has an influence on the following round if the shuffling is not really randomizing the cards.
It often happens that several consecutive cards of the same color stay together if shuffling in between rounds is not done properly.

We can visualize a few versions of shuffling by drawing colored squares, with the squares being colord consecutively in a lighter shade depending on the value of the card.

Starting with
<div style="width: 90%;margin:auto">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/ligretto/initial.png" style="width:100%; padding: 10px">
</div>

A uniform shuffling would look like this:
<div style="width: 90%;margin:auto">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/ligretto/random.png" style="width:100%; padding: 10px">
</div>

A repeated overhand shuffle, and a repeated imperfect riffle shuffle would lead to the images below:
<div style="width: 100%;margin:auto">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/ligretto/overhand.png" style="width:46%; padding: 10px">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/ligretto/imp_riffle.png" style="width:46%; padding: 10px">
</div>
<figcaption style="padding-bottom: 10px">overhand on the left, imperfect riffle on the right</figcaption>

It should be fairly clear that an overhand shuffle is definitely not sufficient for the task of actually shuffling the cards.
The shortcomings of the overhand shuffle disappear if the process is repeated often enough, but I am assuming that at this point, the player definitely does not shuffle that often.

After a round, the cards are sorted again to be able to coun them - they are not completely sorted by 'deck', but rather by the person they belong to.
Simply removing the cards of the 'opposing' player, and stacking the remaining cards on order on top of the hand cards looks like:
<div style="width: 90%;margin:auto">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/ligretto/field_stack.png" style="width:100%; padding: 10px">
</div>

shuffling this perfectly would lead to
<div style="width: 90%;margin:auto">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/ligretto/field_stack_perfect.png" style="width:100%; padding: 10px">
</div>

applying the repeated shuffles from above to the initial ordering from a game would lead to
<div style="width: 100%;margin:auto">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/ligretto/field_stack_overhand.png" style="width:46%; padding: 10px">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/ligretto/field_stack_imp_riffle.png" style="width:46%; padding: 10px">
</div>
<figcaption style="padding-bottom: 10px">overhand on the left, imperfect riffle on the right</figcaption>

We see that there is still a considerable amount of 'order'<sup>3</sup> in the deck, even after 4 underhand shuffles, whereas the riffle shuffle leads to 'randomness' much faster.
Realistically, no one is really doing the overhand shuffle 10 times, and even if - visual inspection still seems to point to it having more 'order' than the imperfect riffle shuffle after just one iteration.

    <p style="position: absolute;left: 720px; top: -110px;height: 300px;padding: 10px;font-size:10pt; width:200px">
<sup>3</sup>
'Order', respectievely how well something is a bit vague in this context - after all it could be that even a perfect shuffle could lead to all colors being together!
What it boils down to is the likelihood of the blocks staying together: In a perfect shuffle that is fairly unlikely. Doing an overhand shuffle however leads to this result much more often!

# Experiments
In the following, I will only look at two players playing the game with two sets of cards each (i.e. 4 colors, values 1-10, times two) if not specifically mentioned otherwise.

Before running experiments, I briefly want to introduce my hypotheses - the things I want to prove or disprove.
In addition, I'll do a few general analyses to decide if the simulation even makes sense, and to gain intuition on the simulation and the parameters I introduced.
#### Hypotheses
The specific hypotheses I have and want to prove<sup>4</sup> (which is why I am doing this whole thing) are:
<div style="position: relative;" class="post-side-image">
    <p style="position: absolute;left: 720px; top: -50px;height: 300px;padding: 10px;font-size:10pt; width:200px">
<sup>4</sup>
Prove is really too strong of a word here - I am actually searching for evidence for/against the hypothesis. Conclusively proving it is out of reach here.
</p>
</div>
- Badly shuffling the deck after a round gives a significant advantage (due to how the deck is assembled - see above - the cards are fairly in order in the beginning. Having them in order should help you winning.)
- Luck plays a large role - Reformulating this: Given that I lose, what is the probability that I am actually the worse player? <sup>5</sup>

<div style="position: relative;" class="post-side-image">
    <p style="position: absolute;left: 720px; top: 0px;height: 300px;padding: 10px;font-size:10pt; width:200px">
<sup>5</sup>
Sounds like a statistics exercise after you just covered bayes formula? It does because it basically is one!
</p>
</div>

And the things I have been wondering since quite some time:
- When do we run into deadlocks (i.e. no one can lay down a card anymore)?
- Does having high table cards in the beginning lead to a lower probability of winning?
  (I assume it should - since you can't lay them down at the beginning, when your opponent can already do so. But how big of a difference is it?)

# Results
We start by testing the last one first: we compute the sum of the values of the initial table cards of both players, and count the number of wins of player 1.
We then compute the probability of a win simply by dividing the number of wins in a given combination of start-sums by the number of games played.

<div style="width: 60%;margin:auto">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/ligretto/start_wins.png" style="width:100%; padding: 10px">
</div>
<figcaption style="padding-bottom: 10px">Win probability of player 1 for a given inital sum of table-cards.</figcaption>

Ignoring the spurious values of either 1 or 0 where only a low number of games was played, we see:
- The expectation of having a fairly equal win-rate along the symmetry-axis is fulfilled
- A high win-rate is found where player 1 has a low initial sum, and player 2 has a high one.
- From this plot, it seems like the 'isolines' would be along the 'y=x+b'-line, meaning that only the difference in the sum matters

It is likely that it matters how a sum is made up when examining this result closer - do three 3s and two 7s lead to the same result as two 10s and three 1s? Or more generally posed: what is the best starting-configuration for a given sum?

We carry on with the shuffling-question: How big is the advantage of a player that shuffles badly, but plays equally well? And posed the other way around: How much worse (slower/miss cards) - if at all - can a player be, and still win an equal amount by shuffling badly?
