In the context of TSP Art [link], I needed a fairly performant solver of the travelling salesman problem, i.e. finding the minimum length route between a number of given points. The problem is a fairly famous one, and is known to be NP-hard, meaning an exact solution is hard to compute.

Several approximation/algorithms exist, and this post goes over the simplest of them and introduces a general interface to solve (symmetric) TSP instances with euclidean cost functions. In future posts, I will present implementations of increasingly more complex approximation methods.

First the more technical problem statement:

{% highlight python %}
def length(route):
    s = 0
    for i in range(len(route)):
        s += np.linalg.norm(route[i-1] - route[i])
    return s

optimal_route = minimize(lenght(route))
{% endhighlight %}  

Note that this implies several things about optimal routes:
- Routes always end where they start [source]
- Routes do not exhibit crossings [source]
