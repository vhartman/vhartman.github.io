In the context of TSP Art [link], I needed a fairly performant solver of the travelling salesman problem, i.e. finding the minimum length route between a number of given points. The problem is a fairly famous one, and is known to be NP-hard, meaning an exact solution is hard to compute.

Several approximation/algorithms exist, and this post goes over some of them, along with implementations in python. We will go through the algorithms in increasing complexity (in my opinion):

#### Greedy
#### Nearest Neighbor
#### Repeated Nearest Neighbor
#### Simulated Annealing
#### Ant colony optimization
#### 2-opt
#### MST
#### Christofides Algorithm

[Altering existing routes]
#### Pairwise exchange
#### V-opt heuristics
#### Lin-Kernighan heuristics
